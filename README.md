# Project template for setting up C++ projects with CMake

Inspired by the [CMake C++ project template][https://github.com/kigster/cmake-project-template]. 
Added [hunter](https://docs.hunter.sh/en/latest/) as default package manager and [catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) as default testing framework. 
Fork this and you should be ready to go. 
There are example source files for a shared library and an executable in here, replace them with your own files.
